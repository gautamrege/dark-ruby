## What is this talk all about?

It isn't as scary as the name sounds. We LOVE Ruby. This talk is about the nuances of Ruby which we either didn't know, ignored or simply took for granted. 

This talk is for beginners and experts alike - and we have tagged each slide with a colored Ribbon on the top right corner.

* Green - For beginners

This talk aims to bring more awareness of the awesomeness of Ruby and some Ah-ha! moments.

* Fun with Infinity

* Base conversions
* Case statements and ===
* Curried Proc
* Revelations of Private and Protected methods
* Keywords 
* Module inheritance 
* super
* Cherry picking module methods.

## What's not covered (as yet)?

Well, this was getting to be a very long talk - so we cut down on it. Some thing we are not talking about but will add to the presentation later.

* Object ids
* Fun with Procs, lambda and stubby procs
* Ruby nuances wiht Regex `g /h/i` and `g/h/i`
* Ruby nuances between hashes and blocks `{ }` syntax.
