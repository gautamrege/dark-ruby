# The Dark Side of Ruby

I love Ruby! But as in any relationship, to love means that you (often) have to accept the “dark side” too! Ruby is human in nature and has a lot of gotchas, tricks, wierdness and sometimes scary features that I plan to highlight. This talk aims to provide the “Ah-ha!” moments when working in Ruby.

This is for beginners and experts alike – in fact, all the documents are prefixed with a "B" for beginners and "E" for Expert!
